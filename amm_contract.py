High‑level description and placeholder for the Liquid covenant script.

The covenant represents a constant‑product AMM pool on the Liquid
Network.  It holds a UTXO containing two assets (L‑BTC and L‑USDT) and
enforces that any transaction spending this UTXO must:

1. Maintain the invariant `x * y = k`, where `x` and `y` are the
   post‑swap balances of L‑BTC and L‑USDT.  A small fee is applied
   by slightly increasing `k` on each trade.
2. Update the pool’s owner key or re‑encumber the output with the
   same covenant script so that funds remain locked.
3. Allow liquidity providers (LPs) to add or remove liquidity by
   splitting shares proportionally.  LP shares are tracked off‑chain
   in this MVP (i.e., no LP tokens are issued yet).
4. Permit “flash‑loan” style borrowing of one asset when the other
   asset (plus a fee) is returned in the same transaction.  This is
   done by including both the loan output and the repayment input in
   the PSET.

The actual covenant would be encoded in Liquid’s Miniscript or as a
custom script using the new introspection opcodes.  For example, the
script might:

```text
OP_FROMALTSTACK            # push the old LBTC amount
OP_DUP OP_FROMALTSTACK     # push old LUSDT amount
OP_MUL                     # compute old k
OP_SWAP OP_DUP OP_FROMALTSTACK
OP_MUL                     # compute new k
OP_GREATERTHAN             # ensure new k >= old k (including fee)
...                        # verify outputs encumbered correctly
```

Implementing the full script is beyond the scope of this MVP; see
Bitmatrix’s source code for a working example【839791027663161†screenshot】.  In this repository, we
focus on the off‑chain orchestration and provide a placeholder for
where the covenant would be inserted.

# In a real implementation this file would contain Miniscript policy or
# script assembly code for the covenant.  For the MVP we leave it
# empty and document the intended behaviour in the module docstring.
